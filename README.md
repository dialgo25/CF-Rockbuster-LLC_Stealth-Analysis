# Rockbuster-LLC_Stealth-Analysis
Documentation of an Analysis Project done on the ficticious movie rental company Rockbuster, as part of the CF Data Analysis Certification course.

## Background
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board asked a series of business questions and
they expected data-driven answers that they could use for their 2020 company strategy.  
Main questions they wanted to answer were:

  - Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
  - What was the average rental duration for all videos?
  - Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
  - Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
  - Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data Set
In this project a data set containing information about Rockbusterâ€™s
film inventory, customers, and payments, among other thing, was used.
